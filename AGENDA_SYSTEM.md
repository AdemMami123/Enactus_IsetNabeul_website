## Firestore Security Rules

```javascript
match /events/{eventId} {
  // All authenticated users can read events
  allow read: if request.auth != null;
  
  // Authenticated users can create events
  allow create: if request.auth != null &&
                   request.resource.data.createdBy == request.auth.uid;
  
  // Users can update/delete their own events
  allow update, delete: if request.auth != null &&
                           resource.data.createdBy == request.auth.uid;
  
  // Admins can manage all events
  allow write: if request.auth != null && 
                  get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.role == 'admin';
}
```
