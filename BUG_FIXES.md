# Bug Fixes - Links & Floating Members

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: External Links Not Working Properly
**Problem:** When clicking on post links like `www.google.com`, they were being treated as relative URLs, resulting in:
- Local: `http://localhost:3000/dashboard/www.google.com`
- Production: `https://enactus-iset-nabeul.vercel.app/www.google.com`

**Solution:** Added a helper function `ensureHttps()` that automatically prepends `https://` to URLs that don't already have a protocol.

**Files Updated:**
1. `components/PostManager.tsx` - Added helper function and updated link rendering
2. `components/PostsSection.tsx` - Added helper function and updated link rendering

**How it works:**
```typescript
const ensureHttps = (url: string): string => {
  if (!url) return "";
  const trimmedUrl = url.trim();
  if (trimmedUrl.startsWith("http://") || trimmedUrl.startsWith("https://")) {
    return trimmedUrl;
  }
  return `https://${trimmedUrl}`;
};
```

**Examples:**
- `www.google.com` → `https://www.google.com`
- `google.com` → `https://google.com`
- `https://google.com` → `https://google.com` (unchanged)
- `http://example.com` → `http://example.com` (unchanged)

### Issue 2: Floating Members Not Showing When Not Logged In
**Problem:** On the deployed version, floating member images were only visible when logged in, but disappeared when not logged in.

**Root Cause:** Firestore security rule for the `members` collection required authentication:
```javascript
allow read: if request.auth != null;
```

**Solution:** Changed the rule to allow public read access since member profiles should be visible to everyone on the homepage:
```javascript
allow read: if true;
```

**File Updated:**
- `firestore.rules` - Changed members collection read permission from auth-required to public

---

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Build and Test Locally
```bash
npm run build
npm run dev
```

Test both fixes:
1. Create a post with link `www.google.com`
2. Click the link - should open Google in new tab
3. Log out and check homepage - floating members should still be visible

### Step 2: Deploy Firestore Rules

**Option A: Firebase Console (Recommended)**
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your project: `enactus-iset-nabeul`
3. Navigate to **Firestore Database** → **Rules**
4. Update the `members` collection rule:
   ```javascript
   // Members collection - public data for homepage
   match /members/{memberId} {
     // Anyone can read member profiles (for homepage floating members)
     allow read: if true;
     
     // Users can create/update their own member profile
     allow create, update: if request.auth != null && 
                             (request.auth.uid == memberId || 
                              request.auth.uid == request.resource.data.userId);
     
     // Admins can manage all member profiles
     allow write: if request.auth != null && 
                     exists(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)) &&
                     get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.role == 'admin';
     
     // Users can delete their own member profile
     allow delete: if request.auth != null && 
                      (request.auth.uid == memberId || 
                       request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId);
   }
   ```
5. Click **Publish**

**Option B: Firebase CLI (if you have firebase.json)**
```bash
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

### Step 3: Deploy to Vercel

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Add https protocol to external links and allow public read for members"
git push
```

Vercel will automatically deploy the changes.

### Step 4: Verify Fixes

**Test Links:**
1. Go to deployed site
2. Navigate to any post with external links
3. Click a link (e.g., `www.google.com`)
4. ✅ Should open in new tab, not redirect within your app

**Test Floating Members:**
1. Go to deployed site homepage (NOT logged in)
2. ✅ Floating member images should be visible
3. Hover over images to see tooltips
4. Log in and check again
5. ✅ Should still be visible when logged in

## 🔐 Security Implications

### Members Collection - Now Public Read
**Before:**
- ❌ Only authenticated users could see member profiles
- ❌ Homepage floating members didn't work for visitors

**After:**
- ✅ Anyone can view member profiles (read-only)
- ✅ Homepage floating members visible to all visitors
- ✅ Still protected: Only admins and users can create/update/delete

**What's Exposed:**
- Member names
- Profile photos
- Positions

**What's Protected:**
- Email addresses (in `users` collection, not `members`)
- Personal data (in `users` collection)
- Write access (create/update/delete)

This is **safe** because:
1. The `members` collection only contains public-facing data
2. Sensitive data remains in the `users` collection (auth-protected)
3. Write operations still require authentication
4. This is common practice for public-facing team pages

## 📋 Updated Security Rules Summary

```javascript
// Members collection - PUBLIC READ for homepage
allow read: if true;  // ✅ Anyone can view
allow create, update: if request.auth != null;  // 🔒 Auth required
allow delete: if request.auth != null;  // 🔒 Auth required

// Posts collection - Already public read ✅
allow read: if true;
allow create: if request.auth != null;

// Users collection - PRIVATE ✅
allow read: if request.auth.uid == userId || isAdmin;
allow write: if request.auth.uid == userId || isAdmin;

// Absences collection - AUTH REQUIRED ✅
allow read: if request.auth != null;
allow write: if isAdmin;
```

## 🎯 Expected Results

### Before Fix:
```
User enters: www.google.com
Link href: www.google.com
Browser navigates to: https://your-site.com/www.google.com
Result: ❌ 404 Page Not Found
```

### After Fix:
```
User enters: www.google.com
Link href: https://www.google.com (auto-corrected)
Browser navigates to: https://www.google.com
Result: ✅ Opens Google in new tab
```

### Before Fix (Floating Members):
```
User not logged in → Firestore denies read → No members shown ❌
User logged in → Firestore allows read → Members shown ✅
```

### After Fix (Floating Members):
```
User not logged in → Firestore allows read → Members shown ✅
User logged in → Firestore allows read → Members shown ✅
```

## 🚨 Important Notes

1. **Firestore Rules:** Must be deployed separately from code
2. **Cache:** Clear browser cache if members don't appear immediately
3. **Vercel:** Automatic deployment on git push
4. **Testing:** Test on incognito/private window for logged-out state
