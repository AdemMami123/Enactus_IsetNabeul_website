# Dashboard Dynamic Updates - Implementation Summary

## Changes Made ✅

### 1. **Dynamic Profile Completion**
Previously: Static calculation (50% or 100%)
Now: Real-time calculation based on all profile fields

**Calculation Logic**:
- Checks 6 fields: displayName, email, position, bio, phone, photoURL
- Counts filled fields
- Shows percentage: (filled fields / 6) × 100

**Examples**:
- All fields filled = 100%
- 3 fields filled = 50%
- 4 fields filled = 67%

### 2. **Dynamic Team Members Count**
Previously: Static "10+"
Now: Real count from Firestore `members` collection

**How it works**:
- Fetches all documents from `members` collection
- Displays actual count with "+" suffix
- Updates in real-time when new members join

### 3. **Dynamic Events This Month**
Previously: Static "3"
Now: Real count of events in current month from `events` collection

**How it works**:
- Gets first and last day of current month
- Queries `events` collection for dates in range
- Displays actual count of events
- Updates automatically as events are added/removed

### 4. **Agenda Quick Action Added**
Added new quick action card:
- **Title**: "Manage Agenda"
- **Description**: "View events and tasks"
- **Icon**: Calendar
- **Link**: `/dashboard/agenda`

### 5. **Sidebar Navigation (Already Exists)**
✅ Agenda menu item already present in sidebar:
- Icon: Calendar
- Label: "Agenda"
- Route: `/dashboard/agenda`
- Available to all authenticated users

## Updated Dashboard Stats

### Stats Cards (Top Row)
1. **Profile Completion** (Blue) 
   - Dynamic percentage based on filled fields
   - Updates when profile is edited

2. **Team Members** (Green)
   - Real count from Firestore
   - Shows "X+" format

3. **Events This Month** (Purple)
   - Current month's event count
   - Updates when events are added

4. **Your Role** (Yellow)
   - Shows Admin or Member
   - Based on user role in Firestore

## Quick Actions Grid

Now includes 5-6 cards (6 if admin):
1. Edit Profile
2. **Manage Agenda** ← NEW
3. Create Post
4. Absence List
5. View Team
6. Admin Panel (admins only)

## Technical Implementation

### Data Fetching
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  fetchDashboardData();
}, [userProfile]);
```

### Profile Completion Calculation
```typescript
const fields = [
  userProfile.displayName,
  userProfile.email,
  userProfile.position,
  userProfile.bio,
  userProfile.phone,
  userProfile.photoURL,
];
const filledFields = fields.filter(field => field && field.trim() !== "").length;
const completionScore = Math.round((filledFields / fields.length) * 100);
```

### Events Query (This Month)
```typescript
const now = new Date();
const firstDay = new Date(now.getFullYear(), now.getMonth(), 1).toISOString().split("T")[0];
const lastDay = new Date(now.getFullYear(), now.getMonth() + 1, 0).toISOString().split("T")[0];

const eventsQuery = query(
  eventsRef,
  where("date", ">=", firstDay),
  where("date", "<=", lastDay)
);
```

## Loading States

All dynamic stats show "..." while loading:
- Profile Completion: "..."
- Team Members: "..."
- Events This Month: "..."

Once data is fetched, real values appear.
