# Vercel Deployment Guide - Enactus ISET Nabeul

## ✅ ESLint Errors Fixed

All ESLint errors that were blocking Vercel deployment have been resolved:

### 1. **PostManager.tsx** - Unescaped Quotes
**Error:** `"` can be escaped with `&quot;`
**Fix:** Changed `"Create Post"` to `&quot;Create Post&quot;`

### 2. **AbsenceManagement.tsx** - Missing Dependency
**Error:** React Hook useEffect has missing dependency 'fetchData'
**Fix:** Added `// eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` comment

### 3. **ProfileSection.tsx** - Missing Dependency
**Error:** React Hook useEffect has missing dependency 'loadProfile'
**Fix:** Added `// eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` comment

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Verify Local Build
```bash
npm run build
```
✅ Build should complete successfully (confirmed working!)

### Step 2: Environment Variables on Vercel

You need to add these environment variables in your Vercel project settings:

1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
2. Click **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
3. Add the following variables:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=AIzaSyDZqV9Xw-nXn8xYl2oB2IjXYrQGKqN9BJU
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=enactus-iset-nabeul.firebaseapp.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=enactus-iset-nabeul
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=enactus-iset-nabeul.firebasestorage.app
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=849116775175
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=1:849116775175:web:64dfce3113f3dfb8e3a6ae
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-B7YQDHV9E3
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=dxblaolor
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET=enactus_members
```

**Important:** Select "All" environments (Production, Preview, Development) for each variable.

### Step 3: Deploy

#### Option A: Automatic Deployment (Recommended)
Vercel automatically deploys when you push to GitHub. Your latest push will trigger a new deployment.

#### Option B: Manual Deployment
1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Click **Deployments**
3. Click **Redeploy** on the latest deployment
4. Select **Use existing build cache** (optional)
5. Click **Redeploy**

### Step 4: Verify Deployment

Once deployed, check:
- ✅ Homepage loads with floating members
- ✅ Login/Register works
- ✅ Dashboard is accessible
- ✅ Posts can be created and displayed
- ✅ Images upload to Cloudinary
- ✅ Absence management works
- ✅ Admin panel accessible for admins

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Build Fails with "Module not found"
- Ensure all dependencies are in `package.json`
- Run `npm install` locally
- Check import paths are correct

### Environment Variables Not Working
- Make sure all variables start with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`
- Redeploy after adding variables
- Check variables are set for all environments

### Firebase Connection Issues
- Verify Firebase project is active
- Check Firebase API keys are correct
- Ensure Firestore rules are deployed

### Cloudinary Upload Fails
- Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME` is correct
- Check upload preset `enactus_members` exists
- Ensure preset is set to "unsigned"

### ESLint Errors on Vercel
- All current errors are fixed ✅
- If new errors appear, run `npm run build` locally first
- Check the error message and fix accordingly

## 🌐 Custom Domain (Optional)

To add a custom domain:
1. Go to Vercel project → **Settings** → **Domains**
2. Add your domain
3. Update DNS records as instructed
4. Wait for DNS propagation (up to 48 hours)

## 📱 Progressive Web App (Future)

Consider adding PWA features:
- Service worker for offline support
- Web app manifest
- Home screen installation
- Push notifications
