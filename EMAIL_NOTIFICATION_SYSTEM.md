## üöÄ How It Works

### Absence Workflow
1. Admin marks a member as absent (individual or bulk)
2. Absence record is saved to Firestore
3. Email notification is automatically sent to the member
4. Console logs confirmation or error
5. Operation continues even if email fails (non-blocking)

### Agenda Workflow
1. Admin creates a new event in the agenda
2. Event is saved to Firestore
3. System fetches all members from `users` collection
4. Email notification is sent to each member
5. Console logs status for each email
6. Operation continues even if some emails fail

## üß™ Testing

### Test SMTP Connection
Visit: `http://localhost:3000/api/test-email`

Expected response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "SMTP connection verified successfully ‚úÖ"
}
```

### Test Absence Email
1. Go to `/dashboard/absence`
2. Mark a member as absent
3. Check console for: `‚úÖ Email notification sent to [email]`
4. Member receives email

### Test Agenda Email
1. Go to `/dashboard/agenda`
2. Create a new event
3. Check console for: `‚úÖ Agenda email sent to [email]`
4. All members receive email

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Gmail App Password Setup
1. Enable 2-Factor Authentication on your Gmail account
2. Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
3. Generate an app password for "Mail"
4. Use this password in `.env.local` (not your regular password)

### SMTP Settings Explained
- **SMTP_HOST**: Gmail's SMTP server
- **SMTP_PORT**: 587 (TLS/STARTTLS)
- **SMTP_SECURE**: false (we use STARTTLS, not SSL)
- **SMTP_USER**: Your Gmail address
- **SMTP_PASSWORD**: Gmail app password

## üé® Email Design Features

- Professional gradient headers
- Color-coded information boxes
- Mobile-friendly layout

### Accessibility
- Both HTML and plain text versions
- Clear subject lines with emojis for quick identification

## üîí Security & Error Handling

### Security Measures
- Environment variables for sensitive credentials
- No credentials exposed in code
- Secure SMTP connection (TLS)

### Error Handling
- Try-catch blocks around email sending

- Console logging for debugging
- Graceful degradation

## üìä Monitoring

### Console Logs

2. **Email Templates in Database** - Allow admins to customize email templates
3. **Unsubscribe Option** - Let members opt-out of certain notifications
4. **Email Analytics** - Track open rates and click rates
5. **Rich Attachments** - Add event ICS files for calendar import
6. **Batch Sending Optimization** - Use BCC for better performance
7. **Email Scheduling** - Schedule emails for specific times
8. **Multi-language Support** - Support English and Arabic emails

## üìù Notes

- All emails are sent in **French** as per requirements
- Email sending is **asynchronous** and doesn't block UI
- Failed emails are logged but don't stop the process
- Uses **Nodemailer** (most popular Node.js email library)
- Compatible with Gmail and other SMTP providers

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Problem:** "SMTP connection failed"
- **Solution:** Check Gmail app password, verify 2FA is enabled

**Problem:** Emails not being received
- **Solution:** Check spam folder, verify recipient email addresses

**Problem:** "Authentication failed"
- **Solution:** Regenerate Gmail app password, update .env.local

**Problem:** Slow email sending
- **Solution:** Consider implementing email queue for large batches

## üìû Support

For issues with the email system:
1. Check console logs for error messages
2. Test SMTP connection via `/api/test-email`
3. Verify environment variables in `.env.local`
4. Ensure Gmail app password is valid
