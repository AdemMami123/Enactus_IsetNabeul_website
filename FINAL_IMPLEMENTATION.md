    Dashboard
  </Button>
</Link>
```

### 2. Complete User Approval System

#### A. Database Schema Updates
**File:** `contexts/AuthContext.tsx`

**New Types:**
```typescript
export type AccountStatus = "pending" | "approved" | "rejected";

export interface UserProfile {
  // ... existing fields
  accountStatus: AccountStatus; // NEW
  approvedAt?: Date;            // NEW
  rejectedAt?: Date;            // NEW
}
```

#### B. Registration Logic
**File:** `contexts/AuthContext.tsx`

**Flow:**
1. User registers → Firebase Auth creates account
2. Firestore profile created with `accountStatus: "pending"`
3. User is logged out immediately
4. Success message shown: "Registration successful! Your account is pending approval..."

**Key Code:**
```typescript
const createUserProfile = async (uid, email, role) => {
  const userProfile = {
    email,
    role,
    accountStatus: "pending", // All new users start as pending
    createdAt: new Date(),
  };
  await setDoc(doc(db, "users", uid), userProfile);
};
```

#### C. Login Protection
**File:** `contexts/AuthContext.tsx`

**Security Checks:**
```typescript
const login = async (email, password) => {
  const userCredential = await signInWithEmailAndPassword(auth, email, password);
  const profile = await fetchUserProfile(userCredential.user.uid);
  
  // Check account status
  if (profile.accountStatus === "pending") {
    await signOut(auth);
    throw new Error("Your account is pending approval...");
  }
  
  if (profile.accountStatus === "rejected") {
    await signOut(auth);
    throw new Error("Your account has been rejected...");
  }
  
  // Only approved users can proceed
  setUserProfile(profile);
};
```

#### D. User Experience (Registration)
**File:** `components/AuthModal.tsx`

**Features:**
- Added `success` state for messages
- Green success banner after registration
- Red error banner for login failures
- Form clears after successful registration
- No redirect after registration (user must wait for approval)

**Visual Feedback:**
```tsx
{success && (
  <div className="bg-green-500/10 border border-green-500/50 text-green-500">
    {success}
  </div>
)}
```

#### E. Admin Approval Panel
**File:** `components/UserApprovalPanel.tsx`

**Features:**
- Fetches all users from Firestore
- Displays 4 stat cards:
  - Total Users
  - Pending (yellow)
  - Approved (green)  
  - Rejected (red)
- Clickable cards to filter users
- User list showing:
  - Email
  - Role
  - Registration date
  - Status badge
- Action buttons:
  - Green "Approve" for pending users
  - Red "Reject" to block users
  - Can re-approve rejected users
- Real-time updates after actions
- Success/error messages

**Key Functions:**
```typescript
const handleApprove = async (uid) => {
  await updateDoc(doc(db, "users", uid), {
    accountStatus: "approved",
    approvedAt: Timestamp.now(),
  });
  fetchUsers(); // Refresh list
};

const handleReject = async (uid) => {
  await updateDoc(doc(db, "users", uid), {
    accountStatus: "rejected",
    rejectedAt: Timestamp.now(),
  });
  fetchUsers();
};
```

#### F. Admin Panel Integration
**File:** `app/admin/page.tsx`

**Updates:**
- Integrated DashboardLayout (sidebar)
- Shows UserApprovalPanel component
- Welcome message about user approvals
- Protected route (admin only)

## 🔐 Security Implementation

### Client-Side Protection
✅ Login function checks accountStatus  
✅ Automatically logs out pending/rejected users  
✅ Clear error messages for each state  
✅ AuthContext manages authentication state  

### Server-Side Protection
✅ Firestore rules enforce admin-only updates  
✅ Users can create own profile (registration)  
✅ Only admins can modify accountStatus  
✅ Cannot bypass approval via client manipulation  

### Firestore Rules (Already Secure)
```javascript
match /users/{userId} {
  // Users can create during registration
  allow create: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
  
  // Admins can update any user (for approvals)
  allow update: if request.auth != null && 
    get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.role == 'admin';
}
```

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### 1. Test Locally
```bash
npm run dev
```
- Test all features thoroughly
- Try registration, approval, login flows
- Test as both admin and regular user

### 2. Deploy Firestore Rules
```bash
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```
- Ensures server-side security
- Already configured correctly

### 3. Create First Admin
**Option A - Firebase Console:**
1. Go to Firestore
2. Find your user in `users` collection
3. Update fields:
   - `role: "admin"`
   - `accountStatus: "approved"`

**Option B - Code (one-time script):**
```typescript
await updateDoc(doc(db, "users", "YOUR_UID"), {
  role: "admin",
  accountStatus: "approved"
});
```

### 4. Deploy Application
```bash
npm run build
vercel deploy
# or
npm run build && firebase deploy
```

## 💡 Key Design Decisions

### Why Log Out After Registration?
- Prevents pending users from accessing dashboard
- Forces admin approval before any access
- Clear separation between registration and usage

### Why Show Success Message on Registration?
- Users know registration succeeded
- Sets expectation for approval process
- Reduces confusion about waiting period

### Why Allow Re-approval of Rejected Users?
- Admins can fix mistakes
- Handles edge cases (wrong click)
- More flexible system

### Why Treat Old Users as Approved?
- Backward compatibility
- No database migration needed
- Existing users unaffected
