## 🔐 Security Implementation

### Route Protection
- All dashboard pages require authentication
- Protected with `<ProtectedRoute>` wrapper
- Auto-redirect to home if not logged in

### Role-Based Access
- Admin detection via `isAdmin` helper
- Admin-only UI elements hidden from members
- Firestore rules enforce server-side
- Can't bypass with client manipulation

### Firestore Rules Logic
```javascript
// Admins identified by checking users collection
allow create, update, delete: if 
  request.auth != null && 
  exists(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)) &&
  get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.role == 'admin';
```
